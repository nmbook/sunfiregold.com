Sunfire Golden Retrievers Website
=================================

This is the source code for the website live at http://www.sunfiregold.com/

"Sunfire Golden Retrievers" is the name of the kennel that my parents created
in the 1970s. They continue to raise Golden Retrievers with this name to this
day. I created this website in 2004 to replace a static information card page,
and continue to maintain it.

Usage

History
-------

This site has not had a versioning scheme, as all updates before September 2014
were done live. Here are known major changes:

<b>"v1.0.0"</b> (pre-2004)
The original static page. I am unable to find a copy of this as it may have not
been saved by web archive services.

<b>"v2.0.0"</b> (2004-2007)
The GeoCities static pages. I wrote this a long time ago, and may have gone
through a couple button designs before settling on those that resemble the
current ones. Some of these assets are in /assets/old/2/ along with the static
pages.

<b>"v3.0.0"</b> (2007-2010)
The conversion to PHP and a MySQL backend. From now on the "data" and "app"
diverge into separate places. Light use of PHP leads to common templating and
reduction of code.

<b>"v4.0.0"</b> (2010)
More converting, this time adding the backend and editing forms.

<b>"v4.1.0"</b> (2010-2014)
PHP conversion continues and Albums gets a dedicated thumbnail creator, to
improve the speed of the image delivery and allow arbitrary image sizes stored
that will be scaled before delivery.

The first uploaded version is retroactively named "v4.100.0" since an unknown
number of changes have occured.
